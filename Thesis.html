                <h2>Improving Children's Literacy</h2>
                <p>Early childhood education is very important and starts before children even being school at the age of 4 or 5, yet many students are not starting off with as strong of a base as they should. For that reason my senior thesis is looking at why that is and how product design can play a role in improving children's literacy.</p>
            </div>
            <img id="Pie" src="Images/Thesis/Charts.jpg">
            <p id="ThesisImportance">By age 3 children from professional class families know about <b>1,100 words</b>, which is more than <b>twice as many</b> as their less privileged peers. By the age of 4 children from professional class families hear <b>3 times as may words</b>, which is about <b>30 million more words</b>, than children from welfare families.<br>This little early literacy experience has been proven to lead to poor early phonological awareness, slow vocabulary development, and eventually academic failure, and can be seen in reading proficiency levels of 4th graders, which correlates strongly with these results.</p>

            <div class="Sketches">
                <p>Early ideation allowed me explore different methods of exposing children to a larger vocabulary in both quality and quantity. Some early thoughts included an e-reader, speaker, or wearable, before settling on a companion style sevice that can tell stories and have conversations with the child.</p>

            <div class="Sketches">
                <p>Moving forward I decided it was necessary to include a screen to promote visual interactions that helps with learning language through associating what is heard with what is seen, in addition to the primarily auditory interactions a kid will have with the product. It was also important for the final device to have a playful feeling to it so that the child using it finds it enjoyable to use and wants to engage with it.</p>

            <div class="Sketches">
                <p>In order to design the product so that it was more cute and playful I looking for inspiration from successful animated characters that conveyed a friendly nature. I used this inspiration to give the device a more friendly and inviting feel so that a kid would be more comfortable interacting with it.</p>

                <h3>Meet Ollie!</h3>
                <p>Ollie is an artificially intelligent device that uses natural language processing in order to understand the user and respond accordingly. Ollie is capable of telling stories and having conversations, and is intended for children between the age of 2 and 8 years old. Ollie is capable of learning the kidâ€™s interests and preferences and grows with the kid as their preferences and interest change, as well as their literary capabilities.</p>
