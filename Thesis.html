                <h2>Improving Children's Literacy</h2>
                <p>Early childhood education is very important and starts before children even start school at the age of 4 or 5, yet many students are not starting off with as strong of a base as they should. For that reason my senior thesis is looking at why that is and how product design can play a role in improving children's literacy.</p>

            <img id="Pie" src="Images/Thesis/Pie.jpg">
            <p id="ThesisImportance">By age 3 children from professional class families know about <b>11,000 words</b>, which is more than <b>twice as many</b> as their less privileged peers. By the age of 4 children from professional class families hear <b>3 times as may words</b>, which is about <b>30 million more words</b>, than children from welfare families.<br>This little early literacy experience has been proven to lead to poor early phonological awareness, slow vocabulary development, and eventually academic failure, which perpetuates the cycle.</p>

                <p>Early ideation allowed me explore different methods of exposing children to a larger vocabulary in both quality and quantity. Some early thoughts included an e-reader, speaker, or wearable, before settling on a companion style device that can tell stories and have conversations with the child.</p>

            <div class="Sketches">
                <p>Moving forward I intend to settle on a final form that has a screen to promote visual interactions that helps with learning language through associating what is heard with what is visible, and the object will need to have a speaker for the auditory interaction. Additionally the final device will need to have a playful feeling to it so that the child using it finds it enjoyable to use and wants to engage with it.</p>
